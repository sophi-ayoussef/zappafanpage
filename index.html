<p>Zappa was an eccentric musician with a knack for making music that sounds<br>
  like it was made during the peak of an LSD binge,<br>
   but suprisingly he was straightedge! Crazy, I know.<br>
   In addition to being a sober icon he was an insanely<br>
   talented guitarist. His ability to name songs is unparalleled<br>
   with such classics as "Don't Eat the Yellow Snow" and "Why Does<br>
   it Hurt When I Pee?"" (But in all seriousness these songs are important<br>
   for the progressive rock movement.)
</p>

<p> He was apart of a band called the Mothers of Invention and<br>
  they were as noncomformist as one could possibly imagine<br>
  from their album art to Zappa's eccentric appearance<br>
  everything about them screamed "we will piss off your parents."<br>
  their mission was to essentially satirize as much of American<br>
  society and culture as possible. They based an entire album<br>
  on riduculing The Beatles and the hippie movement they endorsed,<br>
  famously titled "We're Only In It For the Money."
