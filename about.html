  Frank Zappa was a self taught musician,<br>
  composer, performer whose career spanned<br>
  over thirty years. In addition to being<br>
  member of the Mothers of Invention, who as<br>
  a collaborative group released over 60 albums<br>
  he was also a solo artist producing many unique<br>
  works of his own. His genre of music really could <br>
  not be classified or put into a box becuase it <br>
  encompassed so many different styles of music and <br>
  had a feel and sound that was entirely its own thing.<br>
  The Mothers of Invention debuted in 1966 with their<br>
  first album titled "Freak Out!" His musical style and <br>
  incorporation of political and societal satire led<br>
  to him being referred to as the "godfather" of <br>
  comedy rock. In addition to the incorporation of<br>
   political ideologies in his music he also held strong<br>
 opinions regarding many different matters that were<br>
  famously controversial during the 1960s and 1970s, <br>
  including the War on Drugs and media censorship. <br>
  Despite not being a drug user himself, and in fact <br>
  strongly dissapproving of drug use he vouched for the <br>
   decriminalization and regulation of substances <br>
   believing it would lessen the impact that they<br>
    had on American society. Zappa was also and atheist<br>
  raised in a religious family and generally rejected<br>
   Christian values and had a strong distaste against <br>
   organized religion. Rather than being a figurehead<br>
    and a negative spectacle in the public eye<br>
   like many other "rock" artists of the time Zappa<br>
    established himself as a multi-layered<br>
   person with insightful views on the functions<br>
    of society and how people would compose themselves<br>
   during his lifetime. He truly stood out among the<br>
    crowd and was not afraid to express his thoughts<br>
   and opinions that would be considered highly<br>
    controversial during the era of his fame through<br>
   his music, which was so well executed.<br>
   Jumping way forward, in 1993 Frank Zappa <br>
   contracted prostate cancers and sadly passed away<br>
   shortly before his 53rd birthday.<br>
   He was a legendary musician who created<br>
   masterful works of art and was an inspiration<br>
   to many artists after him. He truly stood out<br>
   and no one can quite match his musical talent<br>
   and his seemingly inherent ability to craft notes<br>
   into something mind-blowing and unique.<br>
